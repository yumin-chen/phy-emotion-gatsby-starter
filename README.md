# `phy-emotion` Gatsby Starter

Website starter kit for [phy-emotion](https://github.com/yumin-chen/phy-emotion), an all-in-JS template engine for you to write everything in JavaScript. No more HTML. No more CSS. Only JavaScript.

This project uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) to statically generate the HTML files with CSS styles, which is then rehydrated back to a full dynamic [Preact](https://preactjs.com) app.
